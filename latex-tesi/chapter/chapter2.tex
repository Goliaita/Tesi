\section{Plant Phenotyping}

Plant phenotyping has been recognized as a bottleneck for improving the efficiency of breeding programs. In recent years, image-based approaches
have shown great potential for high-throughput plant phenotyping, resulting in an increased focus on image-based plant phenotyping.
To meet the world's growing demand, current crop productivity must be roughly doubled by 2050, due to global population growth that may exceed
9 billion by 2050 and 11 billion by 2100. Over the past years, various HTP solutions have been developed to improve phenotyping capability
and throughput, including tower systems, gantry systems, mobile ground systems, and low and high-altitude aerial systems, one obvious trend
has been noted in recent HTP systems, computer vision. Cameras have been used more frequently because of their extensive ability to extract
complex features. 2D images can provide spatial information of a scene plus an additional dimension of data such as spectral information.
3D images can provide a 3D structure of a scene that can be used to calculate morphological features of objects. Finally, 2.5D images retain
information about the image plane structure, which is similar to that of 2D images, and capture depth information about a scene, which can
be used to reconstruct the 3D structure of that scene. one of the first operations to be performed for phenotyping is to identify and
define the phenotypic traits to be measured, which largely determine the use of appropriate imaging modalities for plant detection.
Measuring phenotypic traits usually requires one or more computer vision tasks that can be solved by developing new algorithms or
improving existing ones through conventional image/signal processing, machine learning, or a combination of them. Conventional machine-learning
based approaches have generally improved generalizability, but most still cannot meet the requirements for current phenotypic purposes.
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and enables hierarchical learning of data. The key benefit is that features will be learned
automatically from the input data, thus breaking down barriers to developing intelligent solutions for different of applications.
A commonly used DL architecture is deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs), that were developed for image classification and eventually
demonstrated better performance than humans on the same dataset.

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
Most imaging-based phenotyping applications essentially require solutions for one or more tasks related to image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

\subsection{Image Classification}
Image classification is one of the main tasks of computer vision and aims to assign images with predefined class labels.
The development of modern CNNs for image classification can be grouped into three phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item emergence of modern CNNs;
    \item intensive development and improvement of the CNN architecture;
    \item reinforcement learning for the design of the CNN architecture.
\end{itemize}
After these improvements, representative CNNs can now usually outperform humans in image classification for various datasets. It should be noted that the performance
improvement following the change in CNN architecture was highly dependent on human expertise and tuning efforts, which means that improving the CNN architecture
could be as laborious as feature engineering in traditional ML. A reinforcement learning framework was introduced to search for optimal convolutional cells on a small
annotated dataset, and the resulting cells were stacked in different ways and transferred to an unknown large dataset. In addition to performance improvement, studies
have been conducted to understand the mechanism of CNNs. This leads to the development of techniques towards explainable artificial intelligence that helps in developing
interpretable and inclusive machine learning models. The study also showed that learned features could be generalized to various classifiers, suggesting that CNNs could
learn general representations of images rather than specific features for classification. Subsequent studies have continued in this direction and developed various
gradient-based methods that can visualize the importance of features for classification results. Commonly used methods include guided backpropagation, gradient-weighted
class activation mapping, and layered relevance propagation.


\subsection{Object Detection}
Object detection attempts to detect and classify all potential objects in a given image. The use of CNNs for object detection can be categorized into two groups:
one-stage and two-stage CNN architecture. Two-stage models first detect candidate object regions and then classify the candidate regions into different object categories.
The OverFeat framework was developed to use a single CNN to extract features for training classifiers and regressors separately. The trained classifiers and regressors
were used to predict class labels and bounding box coordinates, respectively, for candidate region of interest generated using a sliding window method.

Three key techniques in the CNN architecture of the RCNN family were identified, including the region proposal network, the region-of-interest pooling operation, and
the multitask loss function. A RPN was developed to generate ROIs of candidate objects using features extracted from CNNs, which simultaneously saved processing time
and increased the accuracy of the region proposal. A ROI pooling operation was developed to extract a fixed number of features from ROIs of various sizes, thus avoiding
repeated computation of features for different ROIs. A multitask loss function was used to unify the training process, which allowed for a training process for object
detection. 

Representative one-stage models include the you-onlylook-once family and the single-shot detector framework. A critical problem, however, has been
discovered for these one-stage models: an extreme imbalance in the number of object and background regions. Most image regions contain only background information,
providing little contribution to the model training process. However, if detection accuracy is the most important factor to consider, two-stage models would be
the option; otherwise, single-stage models provide better computational efficiency for embedded systems and real-time applications.

\subsection{Image Segmentation}
Semantic segmentation seeks to provide masks for objects with the same semantic meaning, while instance segmentation seeks to provide individual objects in a given image.
These in general can be divided into two categories: those encoder-decoder based, and those based on detection. The encoder-decoder-based is divided into two phases.
The encoding phase uses CNNs to extract semantically meaningful feature maps from the input images, and the decoding phase uses transposed convolution for upsampling
the extracted feature maps to labels. A detection-based framework is based on the CNN architecture for object detection. Several studies have explored the use of
object detection models for instance segmentation, including concurrent detection and segmentation based on RCNN and DeepMask based on Faster RCNN.

\section{CNN Applied to Plant Phenotyping}
\subsection{Plant Development}
Morphological changes in plant shoots are critical in describing plant development. Canopy cover and leaf area are two commonly used parameters to quantify plant
growth and development. In order to segment plants many studies used color-based features, but usually had imperfect segmentation because plant color could have large
variations due to illumination, shade, occlusion, and so forth. Most studies conducted on CNN in plant phenotyping consider it a semantic segmentation task and use
an encoder-decoder-based CNN architecture for processing. Although these studies have shown improved segmentation accuracy, annotation of training data can be
extremely difficult. To solve this problem, one study attempted to generate synthetic images with semantic annotations automatically for training the CNN model.
The combination of synthetic and real images would improve the generalizability of CNNs for plant segmentation and thus the accuracy of growth analysis.
The researchers also combined CNNs with other DL methods for characterizing plant development. CNNs were used as a feature extractor to encode the spatial
state of plants at individual growth stages, and RNNs were used to incorporate all spatial encodings to learn the temporal changes of plants. In this way,
plant growth patterns could be fully encoded by neural networks to reveal differences between cultivars and treatment groups. This indirect phenotyping scheme
could be particularly useful for selection-oriented programs, but explaining selection would be a significant challenge and barrier to many research studies that
aim to understand the mechanism of many plant responses. In addition to morphological measurements, CNNs could be used to monitor some plant development events
such as plant lodging. A new CNN architecture (LodgeNet) was developed by integrating a custom 7-layer CNN model with handcrafted features. Compared with
10 well-established CNN architectures, LodgeNet provided comparable or better performance on differentiation between allurement and regular plots, but with a
significant improvement in processing speed.

\subsection{Plant Stress Phenotyping}
Plant stress phenotyping aims to identify and evaluate plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses, providing information for selection of accession lines
with high stress resistance and tolerance in breeding programs and understanding of intrinsic mechanisms in genetics/genomics studies.
Plant stress phenotyping can be categorized into four stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item identification (presence of stress);
\item classification (type of stress); 
\item quantification (severity of stress);
\item prediction (possibility of stress occurrence).
\end{itemize}
The development of image classification-based approaches can be divided into two phases. In the first phase, studies have intensively investigated known
and customized CNN architectures because of the availability of annotated datasets and the simplicity of implementing and training CNN for image classification.
Data annotation for image classification is also relatively easy, so a large number of images in a newly collected dataset can be annotated in reasonable time and
cost, especially when a proper data collection procedure is used. As a result, studies related to plant stress detection typically have a sufficient number of
images annotated for model training. In the second phase, pioneering studies sought to understand the reasons leading to the high performance of CNNs for stress
identification and classification, because understanding would not only help to improve CNNs but also ensure the biological correctness of the results obtained.
Although some studies have adopted deconvolution layers to visualize activated pixels in different convolution layers, the visualization results have not been
used to compare with human evaluation or correlate with biological knowledge. Compared with the first phase studies, the two pioneering studies demonstrated the importance of
understanding the mechanism of CNNs for stress phenotyping, as well as the potential for quantifying stress severity. Image annotation is still recognized as a limiting factor
for the use of many DL algorithms, so the researchers investigated the use of generative adversarial networks to generate synthetic images for training CNN models for
plant stress detection and classification. A very recent study explored the use of a custom CNN architecture to detect plant diseases in hyperspectral images.
The novelty of the custom architecture is the use of a 3D convolution operation that can directly convolve spatial and spectral information into hypercubes.
This would not only inspire future studies related to plant stresses, but also allow the reanalysis of many previous hyperspectral images collected for plant
stress analysis. With improved detection accuracy, subtle differences in stress between cultivars/treatments can be revealed to improve our understanding of plant
responses to stresses.

\subsection{Plant Counting}
Counting plants and plant organs is critical to characterizing plant development.
Regression or image classification is the simplest and most straightforward way for fruit/organ counting from the perspective of technical development.
For regression-based methods, a major modification was made that replaced the softmax layer of a CNN with a single neuron for regression of numerical values.
This simple end-to-end counting solution provided high accuracy for counting fruit and leaves from plants. A particular challenge of regression-based solutions
is the limited availability of annotated images, which leads to many potential problems such as poor generalizability of the model. To address this issue,
one study attempted to generate synthetic data of tomatoes to increase data availability and diversity. Although the trained CNNs achieved 91\%
counting accuracy on real images, the study tested only red tomatoes, which have distinctive color characteristics from the background. The generalizability
of this approach should be further validated for challenging situations such as detecting green tomatoes from leaves. GANs were also used to generate synthetic
data for model training.

An alternative approach was to use patch-based training. TasselNet was developed to count corn tassels in two phases. In the first phase,
a local CNN regression model was established to predict the number of tassels in each patch of an image. In the second step, the estimated count in each image patch
was averaged over the individual pixels in that patch to create a count map with the same spatial dimension as the original image. The sum of all pixel intensities
in the count map represents the final count of tassels in that image. Experimental results showed that TasselNet achieved counting accuracies from 74.8\% to 97.1\%,
which were 2 to 5 times higher than those of conventional methods. TasselNet uses the patch-based training method, which substantially increases the number of
training images. For classification-based methods, plant/organ counts were treated as a discrete counting problem and, therefore, a predefined score or grade was
assigned to a given image rather than an exact count. An example of a classification-based method is WheatNet, which was developed to predict the percentage of
flowering in wheat images. Multiple images were acquired for each plot. A total of 11 classes were annotated for each plot, corresponding to 11 visual scores with
a percentage header from 0 to 100\% with a 10\% interval. The average prediction of all images in a plot was the final percent header for that plot, which reduced
counting errors due to inaccurate classification.

Object detection is an intuitive approach to counting plants and plant organs in still images: accurate object detection ensures accurate object counts.
DeepFruits was the first study to explore the use of modern CNN architecture for fruit detection. Several key contributions were recognized in this study.
First, transfer learning was used to train a Faster RCNN model with 100 labeled images, demonstrating the potential of using limited labeled images to train the CNN
architecture. Second, when using RGB images, the trained Faster RCNN model provided a 1\% improvement in F1 score over that of the CRF model. Third, data fusion was
conducted at the level of the raw data and at the decision level for the Faster RCNN models. A custom two-step framework was proposed using the superpixels generated
by the simple iterative linear clustering algorithm as proposed regions. A CNN model was used to classify each superpixel as a flower or a non-flower object. While
this approach showed higher performance than conventional ML methods, it has a potential limitation in region proposal. The advantage of the end-to-end CNN architecture
is that they are able to use richer features for accurate localization, especially when the images vary greatly. However, superpixels are subject to image variation and
may not provide optimal region proposals. The generalizability of this approach, therefore, is most likely lower than that of end-to-end methods.
Many studies have also investigated semantic segmentation-based approaches for plant/plant organ counting. CNN architectures for semantic segmentation were first used to
obtain plant/plant-organ masks. Then, the obtained masks were post-processed using conventional computer vision methods to isolate individual plants/plant organs so that
the objects could be counted. An obvious concern is that although CNNs could provide accurate semantic masks, counting accuracy may still suffer from inaccurate
post-processing. To address this concern, studies have explored the use of instance segmentation CNNs that can directly segment individual objects in images. These
studies faced the same challenge in the lack of training data. To overcome this limitation, most of these studies developed algorithms to generate synthetic images for
model training. Two types of image synthesizing methods have been proposed: rule-based and GAN. Rule-based methods use a predefined leaf model to generate a plant based
on predefined growth rules. GAN-based approaches,however, could generate synthetic images without sacrificing leaf structure. Thus, a method combining rule-based and
GAN-based methods was developed for image synthesizing.

\section{3D Phenotyping for Komatsuna dataset}
In this paper, they built a platform to capture overhead views of a plant and measure the environmental conditions around it. They first
selected a plant species, Komatsuna, which is a Japanese mustard spinach and a leafy vegetable. It can be grown indoors, and is known to
be resistant to pests and grows very fast. Hydroponic culture is an alternative method.It is clean, irrigation and fertilization are automated
so that plant growth is accelerated, fewer agricultural chemicals are needed than soil culture, and replanting failures do not normally occur.
Another advantage is that plant root systems can also be measured because roots growing in water can be captured through cameras. For lighting,
they used LED lights, with lighting durations and colors programmable using the software provided. To measure ambient temperature, humidity, and
light intensity, they used a Sony MESH, where light intensity is measured, which can be measured in lux. However, lux may not be appropriate in
a precise sense because it is based on the property of human eyes. To measure the pure energy of lights, photosynthetic photon flux density
(PPFD) is more appropriate in biology. In their platform, lux is used as a simplified index in environmental information. An RGB-D camera
consists of an RGB camera and a structured light or time-of-flight depth camera based on infrared lights. Since the leaf size of plants in the
early stages of growth is small, depth images usually need to be captured at a closer distance from the plant to magnify the size in the
captured images. However, some RGB-D cameras are not designed for such short depth ranges. In their platform, they used Intel RealSense SR300
which is specifically optimized for short-range acquisition.
They created two types of datasets using an RGB-D camera and a multiple RGB camera at approximately 2400 lux, 28 °C, and 30\% humidity.

\subsection{RGB-D Dataset}
Since one RGB-D camera was attached to capture the entire part of the toolkit, each plant region was manually segmented as a plant image
and labeled as a label image. In order to use the dataset for temporal leaf tracking, the same leaf label was assigned to the same leaf in
images captured at different times. The original camera resolution was 640 × 480 and the resolution of the plant images was, for example,
166 × 190 pixels. Because the viewpoints of the RGB and depth images were aligned by the camera library, the labels were valid for both images.
Due to the mismatch between RGB and depth camera, the resulting images were not aligned, so the depth image was aligned into an RGB image in our
platform. For this reason, the authors provided the original depth image and a transformation matrix from the depth image viewpoint to the RGB image
viewpoint so that the point cloud could also be transformed as needed without any interpolation.

\subsection{Multi-View Dataset}
For the multiview dataset, they captured five plants from three different viewpoints and manually segmented them into an individual plant
like images. To use the dataset for spatiotemporal tracking of leaves, the same leaf label was assigned to the same leaf in images
captured with different cameras at different times. The ground truth of the 3D shape was not measured because it was not easy to
capture more accurate 3D shapes than when using multiple high-resolution images. This dataset will be useful for evaluating the
segmentation of spatiotemporal instances for multiple views. In the relevant literature, instance segmentation has typically been
performed using a single view image, and may be more difficult than using multiple views.


\section{Leaf Instance Segmentation}
In this paper, the authors aim to implement a novel strategy to exploit the global feature of invariant leaf shapes across plant species,
and create an automatic generation of leaf patterns for incorporating leaf shape knowledge. Thus, the proposed framework enables the automatic
analysis of different plant species with rich leaf shape variation, thus alleviating the current bottleneck of annotated data.

They present a novel segmentation of the leaf instance with a top-down view of plant images in high-throughput phenotyping platforms.
The acquired images suffer from uneven illumination, moss, and shadows. To address the problem of scene variability, a statistical
image segmentation algorithm Mean-shift Bandwidths Searching Latent Dirichlet Allocation is employed. In order to find the optimal
MeanShift bandwidth for stable segmentation, the authors used LUV distances between topics. However, the color of moss is very similar
to plant leaves, so using LUV distance is not suitable for the studied images. To solve this problem, the authors employed the distance between
texture descriptors.
Plant leaves spread out from the center showing different orientations, so finding candidate regions to leaves will require examining different
combinations of orientations and widths in the RGB image. To constrain the search for possible leaf candidate regions, first the segmented image
is transformed to polar coordinates. The center and radius required for polar transformations are calculated based on its skeletal image. The center
is extracted based on the betweenness centrality of the nodes in the skeleton image. The goal of nominating leaf candidates is to extract leaf representatives
that can be processed by the model generation step. Their algorithm represents the image as a graph with a fixed number of nodes and neighboring nodes
connected by weighted edges. The seed extraction strategy based on the hierarchical representation of slices and its use in the random walk results in
an under-segmentation of the plant image, this is due to the connection property of vertical slices. However, this property also allows for the optimal
segmentation of non-occluded leaves that exist as disconnected regions in the plant image. Given the output of the random path instance, they automatically
isolate the non-occluded leaves by exploiting the symmetry property of the leaves around the medial axis. Two classes of leaf and non-leaf candidates are
generated, then, multiple leaf candidates are removed from the segmented image to obtain a modified mask. If the modified mask belongs to a small area of
the input segmented mask, then these leaf candidates are the final instances of the leaves extracted from the proposed picture. Otherwise, these candidates
form a part of the output instance and the modified mask is used as input for the multi-leaf matching model.
Leaf templates have a great influence on matching multi-leaf templates. Thus, to generate templates that accommodate large variations in
the shape and size of the leaves of a plant species in its growth cycle. A post-processing pipeline is used to remove stems based on the Hough
transform. The Hough transform generates a parameter space, where each pixel in an x-y image space is mapped to a line of an m-c parameter space
and the peaks represent the lines. Since the canonical leaf shape is used, peaks with m centered around zero degrees correspond to stems. Since
the multi-leaf template matching algorithm is sensitive to rotation and scale, the representative shapes are varied using geometric transformations
such as scaling and rotation. This database of templates with different shapes, sizes, and orientations, generated through real-time image sampling,
is employed in multi-leaf template matching. For each pattern, the algorithm first computes the position of the minimum matching Chamfer, then, an
optimal set of leaf candidates based on an objective function with three terms: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item average CM of the selected leaves that promotes the selection of leaf patterns with the minimum CM distance;
    \item the number of estimated leaves selects an optimal number of leaf patterns; 
    \item the distance of the synthesized mask from the selected leaves and the target image mask is selected and that when disposed generates the target mask accurately.
\end{itemize}

Overall, they observed that the output of the Gaussian mixture model appears noisy, while K-means, Otsu's threshold based on excess green features,
and Minervini's algorithm excessively segment the foreground resulting in a disconnected vegetation region. On the other hand, significant agreement
with ground truth can be observed for the modified MSBS-LDA algorithm using texture-based distance metrics. One approach was based on the orientation
field map and leaf tips of the polar transformed image. For leaf tip detection, they chose the Harris-Stephens angle detector. The second approach was
based on the skeletal image of the polar transformed image. Here, the path from the end nodes of the image is traversed and a minimum deviated direction
is employed at the junctions. Based on the quantitative result, it was observed that due to the oversegmentation of the non-overlapping leaves, the instance
output failed the symmetry threshold, however, the instances of the used approaches that labeled as leaf candidates showed good agreement with the corresponding
non-overlapping leaves of the ground truth. It should be noted that the number of leaf candidates extracted plays an important role in the extraction of
representative shapes, especially at later growth stages. Based on the database of plant phenotyping images, for early and middle growth stage images,
multi-leaf pattern matching was not frequently used because the generated leaf candidates comprised 90\% of the input segmented mask. This was due to the
non-overlapping scenarios observed in these images. However, it also led to the neglect of leaves that were highly. The comparative study demonstrates the
efficiency of our proposed structure in relation to different plant species. The strategy to extract non-occluded leaves involves the automatic generation
of shape priors, which can be further used to segment individual leaves into overlapping regions in the image.

\section{Multi-Task Plant Phenotyping}
The main discussion of this paper is the ACID dataset consisting of a doubled haploid population of spring wheat plants was obtained from the Nottingham/BBSRC
Wheat Research Centre and grown in 2l pots in a greenhouse. Imaging was conducted using a 12MP consumer grade camera attached to a custom built imaging system
that provides a consistent black background containing multiple high resolution peaks. Instead of predicting location directly, the authors performs a pixel-wise regression,
identifying the high probability areas of each target. Heatmap regression has been successfully used in, among other things human pose estimation. The network
architecture is based on an encoding/decoding framework, in which a series of convolutional and spatial downsampling operations begin by computing a fixed-dimensional
feature representation of the image. This feature space is then resampled to the original resolution. During training, random augmentation was applied with random
rotation and scaling extracted from normal distributions with standard deviations. The network was trained end-to-end, from scratch, using RMSProp. The authors used
a mean square error loss function with an initial learning rate of $2.5x10^{-4}$, and reduced by a factor of 10 every 200 epochs. Spike and spikelet positions
are computed from each output heatmap using non-maximum suppression. For all output pixels, any pixel with an intensity greater than its four neighbors is classified
as a feature. The number of additional false positives generated by the non-maximum suppression component of their approach is negligible. Accuracy represents the
fraction of detections that are true positives. They applied a distance threshold for successful detection, then varied this threshold to explore the effectiveness
of the approach at different tolerances. A true positive for a spike or spikelet is any predicted location that is within this normalized distance of a ground truth
point. Similarly, a false negative is any ground truth point that is not within the normalized distance of a predicted feature. To measure counting accuracy, they
compared only the number of predicted features against the number of ground truth points and calculated a percentage error, to simulate a counting-based phenotyping
task. Given the lower recall performance on the tips for the 256-pixel input size, one should expect a higher error. they also found a negative value for the error
of the tips indicates that the network tends to underestimate, rather than overestimate the number of spikes.

\section{Fine-Grained Recognition in HTP}
In this paper, the authors pre-process the images with object localization directly based on prior knowledge such as sensor fusion and experiment setup,
object segmentation using green-based brightness thresholds or Otsu threshold, and finally contour extraction as an array of contour pixel coordinates.
Then we unfold the 2-dimensional contour into a 1-dimensional radial object descriptor, which indicates the shortest distance from each pixel to the seed.
Then the authors post-process these results, where they normalize the values in ROD in a range of [0,1] and scale them from different lengths into a fixed
by sampling or interpolation. To complete the ROD feature they merge them with another low-level local feature descriptor, the histogram of oriented gradients,
which have local gradients at different orientations, which is powerful for differentiating objects with meaningful texture patterns. The histograms of neighboring
cells are further grouped into block groups with an overlap ratio to enhance local contrast. Another way the authors used to integrate ROD is ResNet-18 which is a
type of CNN with residual parts to skip layers so that higher accuracy can be efficiently achieved by using deeper layers. It is the representative of deep feature
extraction methods because its performance has been demonstrated in plant research. To classify and calculate the loss function, the authors used Softmax regression,
and learned the set of weight parameters by minimizing the loss function. The first experiment involves soybean plots grown in the field using UAS imagery, where we
highlight the robustness of our approach under changing camera angle of view. The second experiment involves rosette plants in the greenhouse using a fixed camera,
where we highlight the robustness of our approach under sus change in growth phase. They evaluated the robustness of ROD and its fusion with HOG and ResNet in
Softmax using seven different approaches. The first two approaches, CNN and ResNet-18, are based on CNN, Each convolution layer is followed by a batch normalization
layer, a ReLu layer, and a max pooling layer. For both CNN and ResNet-18, they manually tuned the mini-batch size and learning rate based on each validation dataset
before finalizing its classification result. By combining all these layers, they obtained five models, which will be trained using the Scaled Conjugate Gradient method.
Using the HTP-Soy dataset, the authors found that ROD-ResNet-Softmax achieves the highest validation mA of 0.947 while ROD-HOG-Softmax achieves the highest test mA
of 0.866, which slightly exceeds ROD-ResNet-Softmax. ROD-Softmax significantly outperforms Fourier-Softmax, which indicates the advantage of ROD over Fourier as a
contour-based mid-level descriptor. It is even surprising to see that ROD-Softmax achieves mA comparable to HOG-Softmax even though HOG contains much richer information.
ROD-HOG-Softmax outperforms ResNet-18 in inference of soybean plots for most pairs of growth stages. The advantage of ROD-HOG-Softmax becomes more apparent during the
later growth stages, where the soybean canopy grows faster and its contour becomes more discriminating. In contrast, in Arabidopsis, Bean, and Komatsuna, the authors
found that ROD-ResNet-Softmax outperforms almost all other approaches in terms of both validation mA and test mA. ROD-Softmax significantly outperforms Fourier-Softmax
and achieves classification accuracy comparable to HOG-Softmax.
