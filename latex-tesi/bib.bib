  abstract = {Effective segmentation of plant leaves is very necessary for non-contact extraction of plant leaf phenotype, especially leaf phenotype under environmental stress. However, the phenotype of leaves will change due to the influence of the environment, which increases the difficulty of detection. In this study, we proposed an accurate automatic segmentation method that combines Mask R-CNN with Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithm based on RGB-D camera to segment overlapped poplar seedling leaves under heavy metal stress. Firstly, an effective encoding method of depth information was used to facilitate the feature extraction of depth information. Next, we deployed Mask R-CNN to train the RGB-D data and fuse their features in the FPN structure to obtain more accurate leaf areas. Based on the detected leaf areas and depth data, DBSCAN based on manifold distance was then applied to segment a single leaves from overlapping leaves in the detected areas. Several analyses were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, including the comparison of our network with classic Mask R-CNN and the comparison of DBSCAN based on manifold distance with other classic clustering methods. We used the pixel-wise Intersection over Union (p-IoU) to evaluate the detection results more accurately. In the experiments, the obtained p-IoU of normal and stressed leaves was 0.885 and 0.874, respectively, with corresponding mean accuracy values of 0.897 and 0.888. From our experimental results, it can be concluded that the proposed method can automatically detect leaves with high accuracy, which can be applied to 3-D leaf phenotype research and automatic plant de-leafing.}

  abstract = {Recent advancements in the area of computer vision-based plant phenotyping are playing an important role, in determining the quantitative phenotypes of plants, and crop yield. Automatic segmentation of plants and its associated structures is the first and most important step in image based plant phenotyping. We design and implement convolutional neural network (CNN) based modified residual U-Net for semantic segmentation of plants from the background. We also use SegNet and U-Net architectures for comparison purpose. In this paper, residual U-Net, SegNet and U-Net models are tested on leaf segmentation challenge (LSC) dataset and fig dataset that are publicly available. LSC dataset consists of images of Arabidopsis and tobacco plants grown under controlled conditions whereas fig dataset includes top view images of fig plants captured in open-field conditions. We have used 8 evaluation metrics for analyzing and comparing the performance of residual U-Net, SegNet and U-Net architectures with the existing algorithms in the literature. Residual U-Net with 15.32 million trainable parameters, outperforms SegNet and other state-of-the-art methods whereas achieves comparable performance with respect to U-Net. Residual U-Net achieves dice coefficient of 0.9709 on LSC dataset and 0.9665 on fig dataset, respectively. The segmentation networks used in this paper can be used for other plant related applications such as plant trait estimation or in quantification of plant stress.}

  abstract       = {This study outlines a new method of automatically estimating weed species and growth stages (from cotyledon until eight leaves are visible) of in situ images covering 18 weed species or families. Images of weeds growing within a variety of crops were gathered across variable environmental conditions with regards to soil types, resolution and light settings. Then, 9649 of these images were used for training the computer, which automatically divided the weeds into nine growth classes. The performance of this proposed convolutional neural network approach was evaluated on a further set of 2516 images, which also varied in term of crop, soil type, image resolution and light conditions. The overall performance of this approach achieved a maximum accuracy of 78% for identifying Polygonum spp. and a minimum accuracy of 46% for blackgrass. In addition, it achieved an average 70% accuracy rate in estimating the number of leaves and 96% accuracy when accepting a deviation of two leaves. These results show that this new method of using deep convolutional neural networks has a relatively high ability to estimate early growth stages across a wide variety of weed species.},

  abstract  = {Fine-Grained Recognition aims to classify sub-category objects such as bird species and car models from imagery. In High-throughput Phenotyping, the required task is to classify individual plant cultivars to assist plant breeding, which has posed three challenges: 1) it is easy to overfit complex features and models, 2) visual conditions change during and between image collection opportunities, and 3) analysis of thousands of cultivars require high-throughput data collection and analysis. To tackle these challenges, we propose a simple but intuitive descriptor, Radial Object Descriptor, to represent plant cultivar objects based on contour. This descriptor is invariant under scaling, rotation, and translation, as well as robust under changes to the plant's growth stage and camera's view angle. Furthermore, we complement this mid-level feature by fusing it with the low-level features (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and deep features (ResNet-18), respectively. We extensively test our fusion approaches using two real world experiments. One experiment is on a novel benchmark dataset (HTP-Soy) in which we collect ~ 2, 000 high-resolution aerial images of outdoor soybean plots. Another experiment is on three datasets of indoor rosette plants. For both experiments, our fusion approaches achieve superior accuracies while maintaining better generalization as compared with traditional approaches.},

However, benchmark data focusing on typical imaging situations and vision tasks are still lacking, making it difficult to compare existing methodologies. This paper describes a collection of benchmark datasets of raw and annotated top-view color images of rosette plants. We briefly describe plant material, imaging setup and procedures for different experiments: one with various cultivars of Arabidopsis and one with tobacco undergoing different treatments. We proceed to define a set of computer vision and classification tasks and provide accompanying datasets and annotations based on our raw data. We describe the annotation process performed by experts and discuss appropriate evaluation criteria. We also offer exemplary use cases and results on some tasks obtained with parts of these data. We hope with the release of this rigorous dataset collection to invigorate the development of algorithms in the context of plant phenotyping but also provide new interesting datasets for the general computer vision community to experiment on. Data are publicly available at http://www.plant-phenotyping.org/datasets.}
